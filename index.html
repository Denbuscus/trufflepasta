        <p>Amazing simple pasta dish, perfect for a simple meatless night. Angel hair pasta sauteed with mushrooms, garlic, cilantro and all flavored with truffle oil and topped with Parmesan cheese.</p>
   
        <p>So I open my pantry door the other day, to find something, and I dig and I dig and I stumble on something I’ve had for a long time but completely forgot about. I found truffle oil!! I love truffle oil and I can’t imagine how I could have forgotten about it, but I did. It’s surprising considering I order truffle fries at the restaurants all the time and always swear that I will make them at home.</p>
        <p>Anyway, I immediately decided to use the oil for dinner. I made this simple and heavenly pasta dish and it was a huge hit. Apartment smelled amazing for like two days and I’m already craving it again.</p>
